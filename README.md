h2. AirSQLite-unit-test

The AirSQLite project was and will continue to be developed using unit tests.  AirSQLite-unit-test contains all unit tests for this project.

h3. Roadmap: Short-term
* Have AirSQLite to be used in Flash projects too.
* Create an Apache Ant build script so that it will output a Flex and Flash SWC file.

h3. Roadmap: Long-term
* Have the project use strong-typed objects for storage.
* Use Hamcrest Matcher "like" methods for transactions, such as: containsString, startsWith and greaterThan.
